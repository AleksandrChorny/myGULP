   <!--This is a project to implement a component approach to website development. The component approach also applies to
   css and html and javascript files.
   Thanks to this approach, you can divide the page into modules (for example, header, footer, banner, slider, etc.) and
   collect other pages from these modules. This gives incredible ease in the future support of the site. Since it is no
   longer necessary to search for the desired class in an endless css file, in order to edit the desired element, it is
   enough to open a small file where it is located.<br>
   <br>
   Simply enable and disable the required modules in the main files.<br>
